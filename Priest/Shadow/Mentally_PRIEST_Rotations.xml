------------------------------
New in this rotation:
   - Added support for MB/MS spam with 4PCT13
   - Improved DoT tracking and refreshing timers
   - Re-implemented leveling profile
   - Fixed: Ultraxion - Hold Left Shift to not use Heroic Will
   - Fixed: Mass Dispel - Hold Right Alt to cast
   - Added more profile seperations.

The rotation should execute as close to perfectly as possible under any circumstances.  I&amp;apos;ve now tried to adjust DoT re-cast timers dynamically and take weight for latency and other haste buffs, they should also refresh whenever you gain any powerful Intellect proc.
