What it does:
-Cast MotW on urself if your out of combat and dont have the buff.
-Cast Lifebloom on your focus target, stack to 3 and keep it stacked on unless you keep pressed LEFT ALT to allow it to bloom and do a big heal. You have to manually select your focus. Preferly a TANK.
-Cast Rejuvenation on yourself, so you can use Swiftmend.
-Cast Wild Growth on every CoolDown.
-Cast Swiftmend on every CoolDown.

How to make the most healing out of it:
-Always stay in a place were theres alot of ppl, so you can always make the best use of Wild Growth, and Swiftmend.

Manualy use TRANQUILITY and TREE OF LIFE FORM to improve even more your healing. Use your brain when using this 2 abilitys. Better to use them when you know there will be alot of raid damage.</RotationNotes></Rotation></DRUID>
